# Block Labs - Level Editor Docs
Welcome to the level editor documentation! Here you will find tutorials on what each object does, tips on improving your levels, and downloadable templates to guide you through level-making.

>[!NOTE]
>Only Roblox Studio is supported for level creation at the moment. In-game support will be added eventually, but it may take a while.

## [Tutorials](/tutorials)
Use interactive tutorials to learn how to make levels! You should start with [this tutorial](/tutorials/using-the-kit) on downloading, setting up, and using the kit.

## [Objects](/objects)
Learn how to use objects in your levels, like [spawners](/objects/spawner), [manipulators](/objects/manipulators), and every type of [button](/objects/buttons)!

## [Templates](/templates)
Download level templates to help you practice. Try the [tutorial template](/templates/learn-studio) to learn how to use Studio's tools!
>[!WARNING]
>Using a template may lower your chances of getting your level accepted.\
>Submitting unedited templates will result in a submission ban.
