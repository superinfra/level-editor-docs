# 1. Getting the Kit (2 min.)
Welcome to the tutorial! First, you should download the kit. Not much you can do without it, huh? You can do that in two ways:

* Download the .rbxl file directly:
	1. Go [here](/downloads/kit.rbxl).
 	2. Open up a new file in Studio, or [use a template](/templates). (`Ctrl+N` or `Cmd+N` for Mac)
  3. Right-click the Workspace in the Explorer window (View tab > Explorer) and select `Insert From File`.
  4. Select `kit.rbxl` from the file explorer that appears.
     
* Get it from the Creator Marketplace:
  1. Go [here](). <!--TODO: Add link-->
  2. Open up a new file in Studio, or [use a template](/templates). (`Ctrl+N` or `Cmd+N` for Mac)
  3. Open the Toolbox (View tab > Toolbox) and click the tab with an icon of 4 boxes.
  4. Find `Block Labs Kit` and click it to insert it. It should be the first result.
 
* Use the plugin:
  1. Open the Plugins tab in Studio.
  2. Find the `Block Labs Editor Plugin` and click `Insert Kit`.
 
## 1b. Getting the Plugin (Optional, 2 min.)
Even though the plugin is optional, it takes less than 5 minutes to get and provides some helpful features:
* Add the kit in just one click
* Add objects without inserting the kit
* Open templates from inside Studio
* See this documentation without opening your browser
* Easily (create custom blocks)[/tutorials/custom-blocks.md]
