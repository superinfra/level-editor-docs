# Submitting
The level editor is new, so we're going to be holding testing sessions so we can see how everything goes before we completely open submissions!

You can submit on [Discord](discord.gg/s3JJu9ypsJ]) during the following EST times. Click the links to see the time in your time zone!

If all goes well, submissions will open **permanently** in April, and this article will be updated to be more in-depth. The in-game editor will also be released sometime after!
