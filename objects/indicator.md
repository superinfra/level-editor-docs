# Indicator
An **indicator** is a blinking green block that is translucent, uncollidable, and immovable.

# Usage
On harder puzzles, you can place an indicator where a block should go to help guide players. You can either duplicate an indicator from the kit, or for more complex block shapes, you can use the plugin to create one from the currently selected block.
