# Door
A **door** is a simple object that can be opened by a [door button](/objects/buttons/door.md).

# Usage
Doors open when its linked door button is activated. When they open, the `Door` part morphs to match the position and size of the translucent red `OpenPos` part! Note that the `OpenPos` part will be completely transparent in-game, but you can make it transparent yourself if you'd like.

# Properties
|This object has no properties.|
|------------------------------|

# Tips
* You can put this at the start of a conveyor script to stop it from running until the door is opened!
